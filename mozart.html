  <p><img src="images/t-b.png" width="30" height="41" alt="" style="float:left;margin-right:3px;"/> he incredible Requiem is shrouded in mystery. For whom did Mozart compose it? And since he was composing literally on his deathbed, dictating to his assistant Sussmayer, who completed it? So much of the music exists only in sketches, but despite this rough background, the Requiem has become one of the most beloved works by Mozart. Some of the themes are regularly used for TV commercials so there will be many familiar sounds. Our talented singers and professional soloists and instrumentalists are excited to perform this magnificent work by one of the most celebrated composers of the late 18th century.</p>
